        King Noob of the kingdom China dotes on his two daughters so much that
        he decides the kingdom would be better off with more girls than boys,
        and he makes the following decree: <b>All child-bearing couples must
        continue to bear children until they have a daughter!</b><p>
        But to avoid overpopulation, he makes an additional decree: <b>All
        child-bearing couples will stop having children once they have a
        daughter!</b> His subjects immediately begin following his orders.</p>
        After many years, whatâ€™s the expected ratio of girls to boys in China? <p>
        <b>Hint:</b> <br> The likelihood of each baby born being a girl is,
        of course, 50 percent.</p>
